# Haythem Houiji Portfolio

A sleek single-page portfolio showcasing my work and experience.
The site is built with Bootstrap and a small custom stylesheet.
Font Awesome provides the social icons and only a few assets are loaded for fast performance.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a browser to view the portfolio.
Use the **Dark Mode** button in the navigation bar to switch themes. Your preference is saved automatically.

The navigation bar is fixed to the top for easier access.

To update the content, edit `index.html` and the styles in `styles/modern.css`.
