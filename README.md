# Haythem Houiji Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio site built with Bootstrap and custom styles.

## Development

Open `index.html` in your browser to view the site. The `styles` folder contains custom styling including a modern theme.

Use the "Dark Mode" toggle in the navigation bar to switch between light and dark themes. Your preference is saved in `localStorage`.
