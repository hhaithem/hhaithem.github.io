# Haythem Houiji Portfolio

kl9e7n-codex/optimize-and-modernize-design
A sleek single-page portfolio showcasing my work and experience.
The site is built with Bootstrap and a small custom stylesheet.
All unnecessary libraries were removed for faster loading.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a browser to view the portfolio.
Use the **Dark Mode** button in the navigation bar to switch themes. Your preference is saved automatically.

The navigation bar is fixed to the top for easier access.

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio site built with Bootstrap and custom styles.

## Development

Open `index.html` in your browser to view the site. The `styles` folder contains custom styling including a modern theme.
